# Launching My Data Analytics Portfolio

After working on multiple projects in data analytics and web development, I decided it was time to build a personal portfolio that clearly represents who I am as a **Data Analyst** and **IT Specialist**.

This portfolio is not just a website — it is a place where I showcase my analytical thinking, technical skills, and real-world experience in turning data into actionable insights.
